					<FAQ q={'How is this calendar different from other cloud calendars?'}>
						OI Calendar keeps your data private to you! We, OpenIntents, do not
						store or share any user data or analytics. All data generated is
						stored in each users' own storage buckets, called Gaia Hubs. You as
						a user have control over your own hub with your Blockstack id.

					<FAQ q={'Why not login with Facebook or Google? Or my email?'}>
						Most social media companies are providing you with a free account so
						that they can sell your information to the highest bidder.
						Blockstack is different. With Blockstack, YOU control your identity.
